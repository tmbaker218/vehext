HealthQuestionnaire

This script allows data entered into the Google form at https://forms.gle/1SWQzfb1GXCynuxM9 to be emailed to the student completing the form and to the registrar for the Vehicle Extrication class held by the Charlottesville-Albemarle Rescue Squad.

The form serves as a COVID screening tool. Recipients are sent an email based on their responses and present this email at check-in.

This software should be implemented by creating the form, creating a responses spreadsheet, then placing the code in the script editor tab associated with the spreadsheet. Run the code (an error being thrown about "range" is normal when the script is called this way) and grant the permissions requested by the google engine. Then set a trigger so that the script is called on form submit.
